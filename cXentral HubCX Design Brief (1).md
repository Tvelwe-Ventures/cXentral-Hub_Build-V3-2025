# cXentral Hub - Homepage Design Brief

## Overview

The cXentral Hub homepage serves as the primary entry point and first impression for the platform. It must effectively communicate the value proposition of our composable CX platform while conveying a sense of sophistication, innovation, and reliability. The design should balance impactful visuals with clear information hierarchy, drawing inspiration from Attio's clean, functional aesthetic.

## Strategic Objectives

1. Clearly communicate cXentral Hub's unique value proposition as a composable experience orchestration platform
2. Showcase the four building blocks of our platform (Product, Marketplace, Ecosystem, Development)
3. Establish visual credibility and technical sophistication
4. Generate qualified leads through strategic CTAs
5. Provide clear navigation paths for different user personas

## Design Direction

### Visual Style

The homepage will utilize the established cXentral design system with specific attention to:

- **Clean, Functional Layouts**: Information-dense but well-organized sections with thoughtful whitespace
- **Subtle Depth**: Strategic use of elevation and shadows to create visual hierarchy
- **Brand Color Application**: Primary cXentral Blue (#0039FF) for key elements with supporting palette for section differentiation
- **Visual Consistency**: Maintaining coherent styling across all page elements per our design system
- **Responsive Behavior**: Fluid adaptation across all device sizes without compromising information or impact
